1. To begin with this assignment, I started by creating a Django project first, in order to do so making sure I installed the right dependencies, I created a new directory as well as initialized a new virtual environment. Afterwards, I created a text file with all the dependencies I needed and installed them before eventually creating the Django project. Once I did all those, I made sure first that I was able to run the server and once I had done that, I uploadaed the files into a newly created github repository. <br>

After finishing with the intial setup, I started working on the html file which I named as "main". This file would then be inserted a new folder named "template" and in doing so made it easier to separate the main.html with the other files. With the html file created, I was then able to make and add changes which I see fit the theme of my app and further proceeded with the URl routing. In doing so, I was able to make sure that the "main.html" would be displayed when the url is visited. Finally, I finished everything by deploying the app using Adaptable.

4. The purpose of a virtual environment is to help install the required packages for different projects and isolating them in different environments. Since a Django web app requires multiple packages and dependencies, a virtual environment must be used to create one.

5. MVC, MVT, and MVVM are all frequently used design templates. The MVC framework can be separated into three main components: Model, View, Controller. This framework provides a separation between UI logic, input logic, and business logic and is one of the most frequently used web development frameworks currently. The MVT framework is a design pattern for web development which is separated into three main components: Model, View, Template. This structure is typically used for Django projects. The MVVM is a framework that solves all the problems that the MVT and MVC have. This framework can be separated into three layers: Model, View, ViewModel.
